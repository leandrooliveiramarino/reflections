How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

The diff command will highlight the differences so we can find the bug easily.


How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

Having access to the entire history of a file means that I can see the mistakes I've
done and learn from the them.


What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

Pros:
	- I will commit a file when I'm sure that everything is correct;
	- I can separate by different commits what is the most important part of
a project so I can prioritize them;

Cons:
	- I could forget to commit a file;

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

	Because a project normally have multiple files to save at the same time;


How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

	I can use git log and git diff passing a few parameters to have more control
of my commits	
	

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

	Git provide a lot of ways to guarantee that even if something goes wrong, we 
can rollback to where everything was working fine;


Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

	I want to use it for my projects;
